# Funny old PHP

Fancy yourself a PHP programmer? Well, then you probably know of all the ways you can initiate PHP mode, right? 

This is the most used: __<?php__ ... __?>__

It's got an echo mode:   __<?=__ ... __?>__

But did you know you can use ASP tags as well?

So, you can start PHP like this: __<%__ ... __%>__

It's got an echo mode as well:   __<%=__ ... __%>__

But, hey, it would be stupid to stop here. Why not try this?

```__<script language="php">__ ... __</script>__```

Of course it works. :) 

The funny thing is that you can mix and match. So you can open
with classic __<?php__ and close with  __%>__. Or you can open 
with __<%=__ and close with __?>__. Of course, to throw everyone
off, open with ```__<script language="php">__``` and close with 
any of the above.  

Happy coding
